/**
 * A [Partitioner] is used to create the partitions needed when writing to hive.
 *
 * More specifically, it will create directories on the file system,
 * as well as updating the hive metastore with new partition information.
 *
 * Typically, partition strategies include dynamic partitioning, where the
 * system will create new partitions as required, and static partitioning, where
 * partitions are required to be created in advance otherwise an error is throw.
 * (see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/DynamicPartitions).
 *
 * The pre-existing partitions cover both these scenarios in the form of
 * [DynamicPartitioner] and [StaticPartitioner].
 *
 * Users are free to implement their own strategies, for example if they wish
 * the location of partitions to be different from the default hive mechanism.

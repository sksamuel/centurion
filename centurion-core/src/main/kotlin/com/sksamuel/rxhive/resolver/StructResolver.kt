 * An implementation of [StructResolver] that will return a struct that is aligned
 * with the metastore schema by dropping fields present in the struct but not
 * present in the metastore, and padding fields in the metastore but not present
 * in the struct.
 *
 * In other words, if a metastore has schema { a, c } and a struct has
 * schema { b, c, d } then fields { b, d } will be removed from the
 * incoming struct so that it matches the metastore. Field { a } will
 * then be added with a value of null.
 *
 * Any fields in the metastore that are not present in the struct must
 * be marked as nullable or an error will be thrown.
